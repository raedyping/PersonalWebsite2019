I earned my PhD in Psychology from the University of Chicago in 2009. After post-doctoral training in Learning Sciences and in Data Science, I combined my qualitative and quantitative experiences to become a research consultant. I am particularly interested in learning, science, and social justice. I am a first-generation college graduate.
