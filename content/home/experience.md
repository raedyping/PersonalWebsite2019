  I lead research teams from hypothesis through publication on a variety of projects aimed at understanding and improving young children's spatial reasoning. Projects range from naturalistic observations of how parents engage in puzzle play with boy and girl children to laboratory interventions using comparison and contrast to improve preschool children's understanding of geometric categories (i.e., triangles). The idea is that supporting all children's spatial skills as they develop will increase the diversity of the STEM workforce.
